My little routing framework for Deno. WIP.

See example.ts for usage.

Import like:
`import { serve } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendantang/routing-framework/main/mod.ts"`

Still a little unsure of my approach in this framework. I like the simplicity, but I'm not sure if there's a nice way to, for example, have a middleware set a cookie. Express-inspired frameworks use a request context object.
